## 📚 Topics Covered:

### 1. Creating Effective Visualizations: Choosing the Right Chart

* **Standard Chart Types (Insert Tab > Charts Group):**

  * 📊 **Column Charts:** Ideal for comparing values across different categories or showing changes over a short period. Variations include Clustered, Stacked, 100% Stacked.

  *Examples of different column chart types and when to use them*

  * 📊 **Bar Charts:** Similar to column charts but with horizontal bars. Good for comparing many categories or when category labels are long.

  *Bar charts showing comparisons across categories with long labels*

  * 📉 **Line Graphs:** Excellent for showing trends over time (days, months, years) or continuous data. Connects data points with lines.

  *Line graphs showing data trends over time periods*

  * 🧁 **Pie Charts:** Used to show proportions of a whole (parts of 100%). Best for a small number of categories. Avoid using if categories are numerous or very similar in size. Variations include Doughnut charts.

  *Pie and doughnut charts showing proportional data distributions*

  * ⚛️ **Scatter Plots (XY Charts):** Show the relationship or correlation between two numerical variables. Each point represents an observation based on two values.

  ![Scatter Plots](./Images/Lesson6/scatter_plots.png)
  *Scatter plots showing correlations between two variables*

  * 📊 **Histograms:** Visualize the distribution of a single numerical variable by grouping data into bins (ranges) and showing the frequency (count) within each bin. (Found under Statistical charts).

  *Histograms showing the distribution of values in different bins*
* **Chart Elements & Formatting:**

  * Adding/Modifying Titles, Axis Labels, Data Labels, Legends (Use the `+` icon or `Chart Design` tab).
  * Changing Colors, Styles, and Layouts (`Chart Design` tab).
  * Adjusting Axes Scales and Formatting (`Format Axis` pane - double-click axis).

### 2. Conditional Formatting & Data Bars: In-Cell Visualization

* **Conditional Formatting (Home Tab > Styles Group):** Apply formatting (colors, icons, bars) to cells based on their values or specific rules.

  * **Highlight Cells Rules:** Greater than, less than, between, equal to, text that contains, duplicate values, etc.

  ![Highlight Cell Rules](./Images/Lesson6/highlight_cell_rules.png)
  *Using highlight cell rules to identify values meeting specific conditions*

  * **Top/Bottom Rules:** Top 10 items, Bottom 10%, Above/Below Average, etc.

  *Applying top/bottom rules to highlight highest and lowest values*

  * **Data Bars:** Adds colored bars directly within cells, representing the value relative to others in the selected range. Provides a quick visual comparison.

  ![Data Bars](./Images/Lesson6/data_bars.png)
  *Data bars showing relative values within cells*

  * **Color Scales:** Applies a color gradient across cells based on their values (e.g., green for high, red for low).

  ![Color Scales](./Images/Lesson6/color_scales.png)
  *Color scales showing value distribution with color gradients*

  * **Icon Sets:** Adds small icons (arrows, shapes, indicators) to cells based on their values.

  ![Icon Sets](./Images/Lesson6/icon_sets.png)
  *Icon sets visually indicating values with directional or rating symbols*

  * **Managing Rules:** Edit, delete, or change the order of applied rules.

  *Managing multiple conditional formatting rules in a worksheet*

### 3. Introduction to Excel Dashboards: Bringing It All Together

* **What is a Dashboard?** A visual display (often on a single sheet) of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives; consolidated and arranged so the information can be monitored at a glance.

  ![Dashboard Overview](./Images/Lesson6/dashboard_overview.png)
  *Example of a complete Excel dashboard showing multiple data visualizations*
* **Key Components:**

  * **Data Source:** Clean, well-structured data (often an Excel Table).
  * **Analysis Layer:** Pivot Tables or formulas used to summarize the source data.
  * **Presentation Layer:** Charts, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and other visuals derived from the analysis layer.
  * **Interactivity:** Slicers and Timelines (as seen in Lesson 5) to allow users to filter the dashboard dynamically.

  ![Dashboard Components](./Images/Lesson6/dashboard_components.png)
  *The different layers of a dashboard showing how data flows from source to presentation*
* **Design Principles (Basic):**

  * **Audience & Purpose:** Who is it for? What questions should it answer?
  * **Layout:** Organize charts and elements logically. Place important info prominently (top-left often).
  * **Clarity:** Use clear titles and labels. Avoid clutter.
  * **Consistency:** Use consistent colors and formatting.

  ![Dashboard Design](./Images/Lesson6/dashboard_design.png)
  *Examples of good and poor dashboard design practices*
* **Combining Elements:** Arrange Pivot Charts, standard charts (potentially linked to summary data derived from Pivot Tables or formulas), Slicers, and Timelines on a single worksheet.

  * Ensure Slicers/Timelines are connected to the relevant Pivot Tables/Charts (`Report Connections...`).

## 🛠️ Activities: Data Visualization with Real Datasets

### Activity 1: Wine Quality Analysis Dashboard

* **Datasets:** `winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv` (found in Dataset/Lesson6 folder)
* **Goal:** Create a comprehensive dashboard comparing red and white wine characteristics and their quality ratings.
* **Steps:**
  1. 📥 **Import Data:** Import both wine quality datasets into separate worksheets in a new workbook.
  2. 💾 **Save:** Save the workbook as `Wine_Quality_Dashboard.xlsx`.
  3. 📊 **Prepare Summary Tables:**
     * Create a worksheet named "Analysis" where you'll prepare summary statistics for both wine types
