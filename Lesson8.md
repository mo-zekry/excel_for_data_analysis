### 2. Presentation Basics: Communicating Your Findings

* **Know Your Audience:** Tailor the presentation to their level of understanding and interest.
* **Define the Key Message:** What is the main takeaway or insight you want to convey?
* **Structure:**

  * **Introduction:** Briefly state the objective of the analysis.
  * **Key Findings:** Present the most important insights, supported by visuals (charts from your dashboard).
  * **Supporting Details:** Briefly explain the data and methodology if necessary.
  * **Conclusion/Recommendations:** Summarize the findings and suggest potential actions or next steps based on the analysis.

  ![Presentation Structure](./Images/Lesson8/presentation_structure.png)
  *Example of a well-structured data presentation with clear sections*
* **Using Excel for Presentation:**

  * **The Dashboard:** Use the interactive dashboard itself to walk through findings, filtering live to answer questions.
  * **Clean Visuals:** Ensure charts are clearly labeled, titled, and easy to understand. Avoid clutter.
  * **Highlighting:** Use callouts, annotations (can be added via Insert > Shapes), or simply point out key areas on charts during the presentation.
  * **Storytelling:** Guide the audience through the data story – what was the question, what does the data show, what does it mean?
