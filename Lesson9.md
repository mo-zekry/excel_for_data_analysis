### 2. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

* **Pitfalls:**

  * Working with poorly structured/unclean data.
  * Incorrect `VLOOKUP` usage (forgetting `FALSE` for exact match, first column limitation).
  * Over-reliance on manual formatting instead of styles or tables.
  * Not using Absolute/Relative references correctly when copying formulas.
  * Creating overly complex, hard-to-understand formulas.
  * Using Pie charts for too many categories.
  * Not refreshing Pivot Tables after source data changes.

  ![Common Pitfalls](./Images/Lesson9/common_pitfalls.png)
  *Visual examples of common Excel mistakes to avoid*
* **Best Practices:**

  * **Structure Data Well:** Use Excel Tables (`Ctrl+T`) for structured data.
  * **Clean Data First:** Address quality issues before analysis.
  * **Use Appropriate Functions:** Choose the right tool for the job (e.g., `INDEX/MATCH` over `VLOOKUP` for flexibility).
  * **Keep Formulas Simple:** Break down complex calculations if needed.
  * **Document Your Work:** Use comments or helper cells to explain complex logic.
  * **Choose Clear Visualizations:** Select chart types appropriate for the data and message.
  * **Label Everything:** Ensure charts and tables have clear titles and labels.
  * **Save Incrementally:** Save versions of your work, especially before major changes.
